      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If we dont wake up at 7 the program will ingore the function for what happens if we wake up at 7 and move down to the function 
        for whats going to happen if we dont wake up at 7, on part one the output would be nothing. If we wake up at 7 the ouput would be that 
        we could take the buss
      </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p></p>  The output for waking up at 7 would be the same but for anything over or under the programm would output different answers depending
      on wakeuptime's value 
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>Explained in the text above, part 3 of the code would have more else if statements]</p>
     
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol> This would just tell us that the value given to the variable "number" is the same as the nummber given in the if statement, 
    its neither greater or lesser so it would be equal?

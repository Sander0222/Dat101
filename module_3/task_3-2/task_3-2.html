1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?
- Yes, you can make the condidtion for the first the loop to go trough all loop outcomes.
2. In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
your answer.
- while(guessNumber !== answerNumber) this would create a infinite loop since guessNumber is never defined 
3. Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?
- Modern computers are very fast, as we saw in class it can take milisecounds to secounds. The computer will focus its resources to complete the loop
4. Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?
- I have no idea

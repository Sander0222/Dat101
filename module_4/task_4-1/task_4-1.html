1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?
- Gives us the oppertunity to reuse code for other or simmular tasks.
2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.
- The object called accounttype is used to hold information/code that we will use further on in the development of the code, reusing code
will make development much quicker.
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.
it makes the code "Smaller" by leaving out the code further down the development of the program. It sitz behind and only comes forth 
when called for. It also protects the function of the code from unintended interactions.
4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.
when we use new we call for a line of code that has a function and a value. when we use new we keep the function
of the code but assign it a new value.

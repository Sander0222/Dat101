      Individual Submission: After your group discussion, take some time to individually reflect on the key
      takeaways and insights you gained. Use this information to inform your final submission, ensuring it
      accurately reflects your own understanding. And place them in separate paragraphs above the JavaScript
      element in your task_4-2.html file.

      - 

      1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!
 -     An array is a data struckture that stores values

2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").
- Hardcode is when we put fixed values into the sourcecode of the program. We do this instead of providing the values as user inputs.
3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
(humans) don't "know" how long the array is.
- 
4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?
- If we were to remove something from the array it would still work and it gives us the option to document what has been removed from the array 

5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
"Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
participate in the competition!)
- tbh im not sure, i know we assign values to the days to make them different from eachother. This also gives us the option the sort the values and call for certian ones.

6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.
-  what it does is passing a argument from a function to another function.  
7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.
- The sort method in JavaScript works by comparing two elements at a time, repeatedly invoking the comparison 
callback function to determine their relative order. The callback function decides whether the first element 
should come before, after, or remain in the same position as the second element.
8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
contains.
- The first array is telling us which row we are on, it starts with row 0 which would be row "1"
